# BitHunter
bit-hunter.info web site

Simple setup for devs and designers.

Clone and get started:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:yongbolv/bithunter.git
$ cd bithunter
$ npm install
```

All the source, html and sass, is under the `src/` folder.  Builds output to the `public/` folder, which is also where the
static assets like images and third-party `.css` files live.

You can kick off the site, with live refresh, by running:

```
$ npm start
```
